Remixdb
=======

## A fully distributed NoSQL database, built on the Redis protocol
RemixDB is a distributed NoSQL database, that implements the [Redis](http://redis.io) protocol, built on the legendary Erlang VM.


## Features
- True Parallelism: Unlike Redis, which is single threaded, RemixDB is built to take advantage of all the cores on your machine.
- Truly Distributed: Built on the Erlang VM, RemixDB takes full advantage of OTP and all of the distributed goodies that ship in the Erlang VM.
- Fault Tolerant: Failure in software is not a matter of if, but rather a matter of when. Taking full advantage of Supervisor Trees, RemixDB is built from the ground up with failure in mind and how best to recover from it.
- Mo' core Mo' speed: Let's face it, clock speeds are done going up and we are now looking at rapid growth in the number of cores on machines. Wouldn't it be nice, if your code got faster as the number of cores increased?
- Clustering/Sharding: You can throw in more instances into you your cluster in real time without bringing down the server. In other words, **real time scaling with zero downtime**.
- Zero Code change required: Your code works with Redis, awesome. RemixDB speaks the Redis protocol. So you can try it without making any code change or changing your drivers. **If it works with Redis, it works with RemixDB**.
